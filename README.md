  [As GenAI Fever Fades - Time to Prioritize Robust Engineering Over Overblown Promises]( https://datachain.ai/blog/robust-engineering-over-overblown-promises) - The data stack generation is determined by a blend of emerging technologies and the applications they enable. We are now entering a new phase of data stack development, characterized by the adoption of foundational models, generative processes, faster time-to-value, and reduced data demands.
  
  [Scalable PDF Document Processing with DataChain and Unstructured.io](https://datachain.ai/blog/datachain-unstructured-pdf-processing) - The open source versions of DataChain and Unstructured.io can work together to scale PDF document processing. In this tutorial you will learn the steps to accomplish this including, how to create and save the DataChain, defining the UDF, and how DataChain versioning works.
  
  [Post-modern AI Data Stack](https://datachain.ai/blog/post-modern-ai-data-stack) - The data stack generation is determined by a blend of emerging technologies and the applications they enable. We are now entering a new phase of data stack development, characterized by the adoption of foundational models, generative processes, faster time-to-value, and reduced data demands.
  
  [You Do the Math: Fine Tuning Multimodal Models (CLIP) to Match Cartoon Images to Joke Captions](https://datachain.ai/blog/multimodal-clip-fine-tuning) - This tutorial shows how to fine tune multimodal models like CLIP to match images to text captions, using cartoons and their joke captions from The New Yorker caption contest.
  We tested the structured output capabilities of Google Gemini Pro, Anthropic Claude, and OpenAI GPT. In their best-performing configurations, all three models can generate structured outputs on a scale of thousands of JSON objects. However, the API capabilities vary significantly in the effort required to prompt the models to produce JSONs and in their ability to adhere to the suggested data model layouts
  
  [Announcing DataChain](https://datachain.ai/blog/datachain-release) - We are introducing DataChain - a new open-source tool that greatly complements DVC to data preparation and dataset curation via local ML models and LLM API calls.
  
  [Dataset Factory - A Toolchain for Generative Computer Vision Datasets](https://datachain.ai/blog/dvcx-dataset-factory-paper) - Data-Centric AI brings new challenges with cost and scale of data curation. Our latest tool DataChain solves these challenges where traditional MLOps tools fall short. This research paper discusses our approach.

  [Tutorial: Scalable and Distributed ML Workflows with DVC and Ray (Part 1)](https://datachain.ai/blog/dvc-ray) - Training Models at scale require advanced tools that manage complexity while ensuring efficiency. This tutorial introduces you to integrating DVC with Ray, turning them into your go-to toolkit for creating automated, scalable, and distributed ML pipelines.
  
  [Tutorial: Scalable and Distributed ML Workflows with DVC and Ray on AWS (Part 2)](https://datachain.ai/blog/dvc-ray-part-2) - In part 2 of the tutorial on DVC with Ray.io, you will learn how to set up a Ray Cluster on AWS to run cloud-based distributed computing with focus on managing increased complexity and leveraging cloud infrastructure to maximize the efficiency and performance of your ML experiments.

  [Running DVC on a SLURM Cluster](https://datachain.ai/blog/dvc-slurm-cluster-exscientia) - For many ML projects, there comes a point when local development hits the wall and we need to scale up the underlying compute resources. Maybe the dataset grows too large for your primary workstation or the deep learning model requires several high-end GPUs. This should be a routine transition for ML developers, and one to which they shouldn‚Äôt have to give much thought. In this blog post, we‚Äôll explain our approach to remote DVC experiments on a SLURM cluster and share some code to get you started with the same.

  [Tutorial: Automate Data Validation and Model Monitoring Pipelines with DVC and Evidently](https://datachain.ai/blog/automate-data-validation-and-model-monitoring-with-evidently-and-dvc) - Imagine you're in charge of weekly batch scoring jobs in a retail setting, where accurately predicting customer behavior is crucial. The challenge? Ensuring your machine learning models remain precise and efficient as time progresses, and verifying that your data consistently reflects the real-world scenario. This tutorial will equip you with the skills to use DVC and Evidently, transforming them into powerful allies for automating data validation and model monitoring pipelines. Tailored for Data Scientists, ML Engineers, MLOps professionals, and Team Leads, this guide offers a streamlined approach to boost and sustain your model's performance in the ever-evolving business landscape.

  [Integrating DVC and Git LFS via libgit2 filters](https://datachain.ai/blog/dvc-git-lfs) - Learn how the latest DVC release (version 3.31.0) now supports reading Git LFS objects, allowing users to import files from platforms like Hugging Face without additional dependencies. The implementation utilizes the Dulwich and pygit2 libraries, providing compatibility with Git LFS within DVC and enhancing its capabilities in managing datasets across Git repositories.

  [Leveraging LLMs in Chatbots: The DVC Approach](https://datachain.ai/blog/leveraging-llms-in-chatbots-the-dvc-approach) - This post explores how the Data Version Control (DVC) tool can enhance the efficiency and organization in designing LLM applications, using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot as an example. This chatbot uses the RAG approach for its computational efficiency, provides cited sources for its answers, and leverages DVC features such as rollback capability, preventing redundant computations, and visual representation through a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

  [Fine-Tuning Large Language Models with a Production-Grade Pipeline](https://datachain.ai/blog/finetune-llm-pipeline-dvc-skypilot) - In this post, we‚Äôll walk through an end-to-end production ML pipeline for fine-tuning large language models using several key technologies: DVC for reproducible pipelines and efficient dataset versioning, SkyPilot for launching cloud compute resources on demand, HuggingFace Transformers and other libraries for efficient transformer model training, and quantization techniques like PEFT and QLoRA for reduced precision and memory usage.

  [The DVC 3.0 Stack: Beyond the Command Line](https://datachain.ai/blog/dvc-3.0-ml-experiments-data-versioning) - DVC has brought engineering best practices to the ML and data world, making model development more standardized and reproducible. Now we want to make it work when the command line isn't the right fit, and it's easier to work in code, an IDE, or on the web. This doesn't mean we forgot about DVC fundamentals ‚Äî data versioning is the core of what we do.
